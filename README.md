Oral Cancer Classification and Detection Using CNN
Oral Cancer is one of the most common types of cancer with a very mortality rate due to delay in diagnosis and inadequate options for treatment. Early diagnosis and accurate classification of oral cancer plays a very important role in successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. In recent years, deep learning-based algorithms have shown promising results in accurately classifying and detecting oral cancer using images.In the project a deep learning-based approach for early classification and detection of oral cancer using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed method consists of a four-layer CNN model, which takes a set of 4,000 preprocessed oral cancer images and outputs a classification label indicating the presence or absence of cancer. In addition to that data augmentation techniques like horizontal and vertical flipping, zooming the image etc. are used in order to increase the amount of training data and improving the performance of the model.The proposed approach is evaluated on a dataset containing images of cancer and non-cancer obtained from various sources. The result obtained demonstrate that the CNN-based approach achieves high accuracy in both cancer classification and detection tasks. The model outperforms methods in terms of accuracy.Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the factors that affect the overall performance of the model was conducted and through this the impact of various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs was considered which in turn affects accuracy of the model.Overall, the proposed approach shows accurate results for classification and detection of oral cancer using deep learning-based techniques. The obtained result demonstrates that CNNâ€™s can effectively learn the features of the dataset and achieve high accuracy in the classification and detection related tasks. The work can be extended in several directions, including the use of more advanced deep-learning architectures and the incorporation of other factors, such as clinical data and genetic information, for more improved diagnosis and treatment.
The objective of the project is to develop an accurate and efficient system that assists in the early detection and classification of oral cancer. The project aims to leverage the capabilities of CNNs to analyze oral cancer images and provide healthcare professionals with a reliable tool for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.
